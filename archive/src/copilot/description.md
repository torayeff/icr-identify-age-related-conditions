# Data Science Co-pilot

## Project description
The data comprises over fifty anonymized health characteristics linked to three age-related conditions. The goal is to predict whether a subject has or has not been diagnosed with one of these conditions -- a binary classification problem.

Files and Field Descriptions

- train.csv - The training set.
    - Id: Unique identifier for each observation.
    - AB-GL: Fifty-six anonymized health characteristics. All are numeric except for EJ, which is categorical.
    - Class: A binary target: 1 indicates the subject has been diagnosed with one of the three conditions, 0 indicates they have not.
- test.csv - The test set. Your goal is to predict the probability that a subject in this set belongs to each of the two classes.
    - greeks.csv - Supplemental metadata, only available for the training set.
        - Alpha Identifies the type of age-related condition, if present.
            - A No age-related condition. Corresponds to class 0.
            - B, D, G The three age-related conditions. Correspond to class 1.
        - Beta, Gamma, Delta Three experimental characteristics.
        - Epsilon The date the data for this subject was collected. Note that all of the data in the test set was collected after the training set was collected.

## Tasks
1. Data Understanding and Exploration:
    - Load the training and test datasets in a Python programming environment.
    - Analyze and explore the data, checking the structure, variable types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
    - Investigate the relationships and distributions among the variables.

2. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handle missing values if any, using appropriate techniques like imputation or removing the records with missing data.
    - Convert the categorical variable 'EJ' into a format suitable for the model (e.g., one-hot encoding).
    - If necessary, normalize or scale numeric variables.

3. Feature Engineering:
    - Explore potential interactions between features or derive new features from existing ones.
    - Merge the "greeks.csv" data with the training data using the ID as the key.
    - Convert 'Alpha' into binary labels.
    - Consider 'Epsilon' (date) for time-series analysis or feature creation.
    - Evaluate 'Beta', 'Gamma', and 'Delta' for potential additional features.

4. Model Selection:
    - Split the training dataset into a training and validation set.
    - Select and configure a number of candidate machine learning algorithms suitable for binary classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).

5. Model Training:
    - Train the models using the training dataset and tune the hyperparameters using the validation set.

6. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score).
    - Conduct a thorough error analysis.

7. Model Selection and Finalization:
    - Select the best performing model based on the evaluation metrics.
    - Refit the chosen model on the entire training dataset.

8. Prediction:
    - Make predictions on the test set using the finalized model.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set, but only if the true labels are known (not usually the case in practice).

9. Reporting:
    - Document the analysis process, findings, limitations, and business implications.
    - Package the code for reproducibility, and save the final model for future use or deployment.
